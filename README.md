# Mail Add Sender

Adds a Sender header to every outgoing Wordpress email if it does not already have one, to make it work with Exim and similar.

This small plugin is originally authored by [Simon Lehmann](https://github.com/simonlmn).   
I'm adding here for so it can be pulled by Composer.   
Happy to remove it once Simon opens it in his own repo.
